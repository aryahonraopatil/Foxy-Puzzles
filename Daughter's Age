A man in my neighborhood has three daughters. One day when I asked their ages he said, “The product of their ages is 36.”

When I still couldn’t find their ages he said, “Ok. I’ll give you another clue: the sum of their ages is same as the number of my house.”

I knew the number but still couldn’t calculate their ages. So the man gave me a last clue, “My eldest daughter lives upstairs.”

Finally I was able to figure out their ages. How old are they?

Hint - There are only so many ways that three numbers can have a product of 36.


Answer - 2,2,9

Solution: 
We know that the product of their ages is 36. 
So let us come with numbers, find the LCM of 36. So we get, 1,2,2,3,3
Now we try to arrange them in a format of 3 numbers togther, because there are 3 daughters. And also write their sums on the side. 
1 + 6 + 6 = 13
1 + 12 + 3 = 16
1 + 2 + 18 = 21
1 + 4 + 9 = 14
2 + 3 + 6 = 11
2 + 2 + 9 = 13
4 + 3 + 3 = 10

Now we know that person knows the house number, so all the house numbers are uniques except for 13, where we have two possibilities i.e. 1,6,6 and 2,2,9. 
We know that the eldest daughter lives upstairs, that means she must be relatively elder and out of the two given possibilities, a 1 year old child cannot live alone. 
So it has to be 2,2,9.
